# optimizing-public-transport

This project is code solution for one of the project of "Data Streaming Nanodegree" course of Udacity.

Project Directions
The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has asked us to develop a dashboard displaying system status for its commuters. We have decided to use Kafka and ecosystem tools like REST Proxy and Kafka Connect to accomplish this task.
